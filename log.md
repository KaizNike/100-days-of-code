# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: October 1, 2020

**Progress Report:** Installed win XP on Virtual Box.

**Future Thoughts:** This counts as day -1. Wanted to try getting some old games running, but ended up deleting the machine. Security risk it can be. Fun lesson in work, had to get several user patches for the OS. Got avast running as well as Sim Earth. It was too unstable however. I'm sure I'll end up trying again, but will focus on getting versions of game that run on 64-bit systems. Also need to repair my game library from my hard drive crash.

### Day 1: October 8, 2020

**Progress Report:** Did CS50 pset5 Speller, a spell checker made in C

**Future Thoughts:** This one was amoung the harder of the problems in my eyes. Mostly because of the leaderboards, still not happy about my time. Hardest part was getting the valgrind errors underway, some were easy (forgetting to close file), some moderate (not freeing every file in array), some needed googling (using calloc instead of malloc).

### Day 2: October 9, 2020

**Progress Report:** Tried a new hash function for Speller, which introduced new errors

**Future Thoughts:** I found djb2 looking around on stack overflow after solving the problem myself. This hash function reduced time from 2.66 seconds to 0.7 seconds. However, the misspelled count went up as some were not matching, I would go on to fix that in the coming days.

### Day 3: October 10, 2020

**Progress Report:** Started a new godot project with per-pixel transparency, now named Screen Toybox.

**Future Thoughts:** I spent a good time while not updating working on this. Will try to be more consistent.

**Project Link:** Upcoming! (Screen Toybox)

### Day 4: October 11, 2020

**Progress Report:** New update for Speller, turning word into a number

**Future Thoughts:** Shaved off 0.5 seconds, looking pretty good for what I understand about hash functions, even now.

### Day 5: October 12, 2020

**Progress Report:** Work on the Toybox, featuring a physics level

**Future Thoughts:** Very fun, but the light I made was a bit bright.

### Day 6: October 13, 2020

**Progress Report:** Work on pset 6 of CS50, Python

**Future Thoughts:** Many things work easier in python than in C. I learned this back in 2013 so its fairly familiar.

### Day 7: October 14, 2020

**Progress Report:** Work on Readability of pset 6 for CS50, Python

**Future Thoughts:** Looks much better in python imo, its very simple making the translation from C to python.

### Day 1: June 27, Monday

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through many exercises on FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts** I've recently started coding, and it's a great feeling when I finally solve an algorithm challenge after a lot of attempts and hours spent.
