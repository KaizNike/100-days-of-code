# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: October 1, 2020

**Progress Report"** Installed win XP on Virtual Box.

**Future Thoughts:** This counts as day -1. Wanted to try getting some old games running, but ended up deleting the machine. Security risk it can be. Fun lesson in work, had to get several user patches for the OS. Got avast running as well as Sim Earth. It was too unstable however. I'm sure I'll end up trying again, but will focus on getting versions of game that run on 64-bit systems. Also need to repair my game library from my hard drive crash.

**Today's Progress**: Fixed CSS, worked on canvas functionality for the app.

**Thoughts:** I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through many exercises on FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts** I've recently started coding, and it's a great feeling when I finally solve an algorithm challenge after a lot of attempts and hours spent.
