# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: October 1, 2020

**Progress Report:** Installed win XP on Virtual Box.

**Future Thoughts:** This counts as day -1. Wanted to try getting some old games running, but ended up deleting the machine. Security risk it can be. Fun lesson in work, had to get several user patches for the OS. Got avast running as well as Sim Earth. It was too unstable however. I'm sure I'll end up trying again, but will focus on getting versions of game that run on 64-bit systems. Also need to repair my game library from my hard drive crash.

### Day 1: October 8, 2020

**Progress Report:** Did CS50 pset5 Speller, a spell checker made in C

**Future Thoughts:** This one was amoung the harder of the problems in my eyes. Mostly because of the leaderboards, still not happy about my time. Hardest part was getting the valgrind errors underway, some were easy (forgetting to close file), some moderate (not freeing every file in array), some needed googling (using calloc instead of malloc).

### Day 2: October 9, 2020

**Progress Report:** Tried a new hash function for Speller, which introduced new errors

**Future Thoughts:** I found djb2 looking around on stack overflow after solving the problem myself. This hash function reduced time from 2.66 seconds to 0.7 seconds. However, the misspelled count went up as some were not matching, I would go on to fix that in the coming days.

### Day 3: October 10, 2020

**Progress Report:** Started a new godot project with per-pixel transparency, now named Screen Toybox.

**Future Thoughts:** I spent a good time while not updating working on this. Will try to be more consistent.

**Project Link:** Upcoming! (Screen Toybox)

### Day 4: October 11, 2020

**Progress Report:** New update for Speller, turning word into a number

**Future Thoughts:** Shaved off 0.5 seconds, looking pretty good for what I understand about hash functions, even now.

### Day 5: October 12, 2020

**Progress Report:** Work on the Toybox, featuring a physics level

**Future Thoughts:** Very fun, but the light I made was a bit bright.

### Day 6: October 13, 2020

**Progress Report:** Work on pset 6 of CS50, Python

**Future Thoughts:** Many things work easier in python than in C. I learned this back in 2013 so its fairly familiar.

### Day 7: October 14, 2020

**Progress Report:** Work on Readability of pset 6 for CS50, Python

**Future Thoughts:** Looks much better in python imo, its very simple making the translation from C to python.

### Day 8: October 15, 2020

**Progress Report:** Work on DNA of pset 6 for CS50, Python

**Future Thoughts:** Stack overflow is an addicting thing, I did most of this problem myself, but in the end, their code was much prettier than what solution I was puzzling over.

### Day 9: October 16, 2020

**Progress Report:** New Toybox Scene (Bubbles) Added!

**Future Thoughts:** Very fun, much pop!

**Future Thoughts:** Now with better pop.

## Extended Break
October 18 - October 29
12 Days Added to Finish, New end date (28 Jan 2021)
Note: Duckduckgo good for calculating dates.


### Day 22: October 30, 2020

**Progress Report:** Started SQL, week 7 of CS50

**Future Thoughts:** Very tricky to start, but I mastered it quickly.

**Twitter Link:** [Day 22](https://twitter.com/KaizarNike/status/1322100082452299776)


### Day 23: October 31, 2020

**Progress Report:** Finished pset 7 of CS50, SQL and Python

**Future Thoughts:** Yesterday from the current perspective! This was quite challenging and I was despairing by the end of the first half. Ended up looking up solutions on Stack Overflow. Did do the majority on my own, but subqueries are still a bit of a mystery to me, will have to spend more time learning SQL in the future.

### Day 24: November 1, 2020

**UPDATE:** Started the github fork, will avoid taking major breaks.

**Update Thoughts:** That was a fair bit of work, luckily its easier going from here. I sure am a nightowl. Now starting 20 minutes of exercise a day, as I have been lax recently.

**Progress Report:** Uploaded my Screen Toybox to Github, to be followed by itch.io release tommorrow.

**Thoughts:** Holy cow the time I spent choosing a license, at first I wanted to enforce that all variations on my program were under the same license, but I settled for MIT, safe and simple. Got a fair bit of exercise in, but will start timing myself to be sure.

### Day 25: November 2, 2020

**Progress Report:** Preparations for itch.io release

**Thoughts:** Plenty of work still to do, I said I would finish by today, but I am spending my free time working on other things. Did you know that PSN for PS3 is still running alright? Of course I had trouble with the web browser, but the youtube app works fine. I love maintaining older consoles, maybe I should learn how to maintain the hardware, sounds tricky!

## Short Break
November 7 - November 11
5 Days Added to Finish, New end date (4 Feb 2021)



### Day 35: November 12, 2020

**Progress Report:** Completed Pong and Mario of CS50 Week 8 Games Track

**Thoughts:** I want to be more consistent in my goals, I've been rather lax thus far. I'll be spending time on the CS50 final project coming up, need to decide on that soon.

**Twitter Link:** [Day 35](https://twitter.com/KaizarNike/status/1326827011394822144)



### Day 36: November 13, 2020

**Progress Report:** Started research for CS50 final project (Roguelike)

**Thoughts:** Been sitting on the concept since June and decided to use it for the final project. Sneak peek is of a roguelike with morality system, where you can save or ruin the worlds in play.

## Study Break
November 14 - November 15
2 Days Added to Finish, New end date (6 Feb 2021)



### Day 39: November 16, 2020

**Progress Report:** Started coding for Three World Champion

**Future Thoughts:** Followed some roguelike tutorials on youtube for Godot to get player movement down. Not too happy with the results. I think I'll go with what I know and store a seperate x and y value in the code to base the players position. Right now I'm using [MostlyMadProduction's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=re4VIqUR6HE) code for the player. 


### Day 40: November 17, 2020

**Progress Report:** Started world gen for Three World Champion

**Thoughts:** Today I've got the basics of worldgen down. I start with an array defined by the caller. Then I iterate through the 2d array twice, once to set the tiles and then again to place them. The world can be any size, limited by memory, but I found 3024x3024 to be as high as I want to go. My idea is of a world map and then level maps. My idea is that for each tile on the world map there is a level hidden on it, that you access by moving down (>), like in Dwarf Fortress. Not too sure if the levels should be uniform and load another at the edge, or differing sizes and change on transition. I will try each.

### Day 1: June 27, Monday

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through many exercises on FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts** I've recently started coding, and it's a great feeling when I finally solve an algorithm challenge after a lot of attempts and hours spent.
